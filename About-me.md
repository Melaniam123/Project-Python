Hello, I'm here on medium to learn from you and share my learnings too. I try to follow a learning roadmap by implementing what I learn and occassionally post my learnings and projects here. Some quick facts about me:
 - 🎓 Alumni from Northeastern Unviersity, MSc Analytics Class - Concentration AI/ML of 2022-23. Made some great friends and learned from some great professors. 
 - 🧑‍🏭 Data @Stacktics, Marketing and Technology Consultancy
 - 📋 Expertise in Python, SQL, R Studio, Matlab, GCP, Snowflake, Google Stack, Tableau, Power Bi, Looker, UnicaIBM, etc
 - ⛽ Fueling my expertise in Cloud Infrastructure, Big Data Technologies and Co-pilot. I enjoy writing on Medium @melania.mendes 
 - 🌝 Funfact - I took the bike into a river 😆 and scuba dived in chilling temperatures.

If you have any questions about my code, analysis or simply want to connect, please add me on LinkedIn @mendesme or write to me at melania.mendes@gmail.com/ mendes.me@northeastern.edu
